Collaboration Project: Stacks and Queues - LIFO, FIFO

Overview
Welcome to the collaborative project between sophie-analytics and Ebukings5! This project focuses on implementing an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. Monty is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes, similar to Python. The language relies on a unique stack with specific instructions to manipulate it. In addition to general stack and queue operations (LIFO, FIFO), we will be implementing Monty 0.98 language instructions.

Project Description
Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. The interpreter should be capable of executing Monty scripts, which contain a series of instructions to manipulate the stack.

Tasks
Stack and Queue Implementation

Implement a stack and a queue with the required operations (push, pop, enqueue, dequeue).
Ensure proper error handling and edge case considerations.
Monty ByteCode Interpreter

Develop an interpreter that reads Monty ByteCodes files and executes the instructions.
Implement Monty language instructions as specified in the Monty 0.98 documentation.
Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
Documentation

Provide clear documentation for your interpreter, including how to run Monty scripts.
Include usage examples and explanations for Monty language instructions.
Collaboration Guidelines

Establish a clear workflow for collaboration, such as branching strategies and pull request guidelines.
Communicate effectively on GitHub issues or any other chosen communication channels.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Monty 0.98 installed on your local machine.
Choose a programming language for implementation and ensure the necessary runtime or interpreter is installed.
